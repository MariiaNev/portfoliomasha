It explores how thoughtful design can transform stressful communication situations into a calmer preparation process, helping people feel confident rather than afraid.","A key focus of the project is preparation for real communication moments. Research and user interviews revealed that people rarely practise “just for practice” — most begin preparing only when a real situation is approaching, such as a presentation, interview, or speech. As a result, the product is designed not as general public speaking training, but as a tool that helps users prepare for specific, real-life events. The goal is to make preparation feel structured, supportive, and easy to start, especially for those who struggle with motivation or fear being judged or making mistakes. The experience combines text-based and voice interactions, personalised preparation flows, and a positive visual direction that creates a sense of safety, support, and confidence"],content:[{type:"img",attr:{src:"/images/unmute/unmute1.webp"}},{type:"img",attr:{src:"/images/unmute/unmute2.webp"}},{type:"img",attr:{src:"/images/unmute/unmute3.webp"}},{type:"cards",attr:{title:"Marketing campaign",cards:[{img:"/images/unmute/unmute7.webp",text:"User Testimonials"},{img:"/images/unmute/unmute8.webp",text:"Brand Merchandise"},{img:"/images/unmute/unmute9.webp",text:"Promotional Website"},{img:"/images/unmute/unmute10.webp",text:"Outdoor Advertising"}]}},{type:"img",attr:{src:"/images/unmute/unmute4.webp"}},{type:"img",attr:{src:"/images/unmute/unmute5.webp"}},{type:"img",attr:{src:"/images/unmute/unmute6.webp"}}],cardsMore:[{img:"/images/homely/homely7.webp",text:"Homely",link:"/projects/homely",year:"2025"},{img:"/images/zeta_group/zeta_group_preview.webp",text:"Zeta Group",link:"/projects/zeta_group",year:"2024"}]},homely:{name:"Homely",description:"Home-Buying Assistant Platform",descriptionAbout:"Digital assistant designed to guide first-home buyers in New Zealand",year:"2025",url:"homely",imagePreview:"/images/homely/preview.jpg",overList:["Homely is a digital assistant designed to support first-home buyers in New Zealand through one of the most complex and stressful life decisions.
